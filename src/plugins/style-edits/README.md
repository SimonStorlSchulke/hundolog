# Strapi Plugin: Responsive Admin Panel

## Overview

The **Responsive Admin Panel Plugin for Strapi v5** enhances the usability of the Strapi admin panel on mobile devices. By introducing targeted CSS adjustments, this plugin ensures that the Strapi backend remains accessible and functional on devices with a screen width of less than **767px**.

### It is still work in progress and works with the Content Manager, Content Type Build, Media & Marketplace yet.

## Installation

### Install via NPM
```bash
npm install strapi-5-plugin-responsive-backend
```

### Add to Your Strapi Project

Ensure the plugin is enabled in your Strapi project. No additional configuration is needed.

### Usage

Once installed, the plugin will **automatically** apply its styles when you access the admin panel on smaller screens. Itâ€™s designed to work out-of-the-box, so you donâ€™t need to configure anything manually.

### Example Adjustments

- **Navigation Bar**: It moved from the left to the top and shrinked in height.
- **Spacing**: Some paddings were adjusted to make the content manager more accessible.
